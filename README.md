# To-Do-List

## Description:
Simple to-do-list app, with no database yet only a local one, it was created along with Tim Buchalka course but with added functionality
and design by myself. It uses Spring 5 framwork, Tomcat for deploying local server for site, Maven for dependency managment and some CSS for styling.
